# Discussion
# 1. Fastest to slowest algorithm run times:
# log n, n, n log n, n**2, 2**n
# 2. Explain two rules a proper recursive definition or function must follow:
# 1. Must have a base case
# 2. Must be a sequencing problem
# 3. foo, ofo, ofo, oof
# 4. skip
# 5. Divide and conquer algorithms are efficient because they quickly rule out large chunks of the
# space that needs to be searched.  Starts in the middle and splits, then repeats. (log n
