# Discussion
# 1. Object-oriented design is the process of developing a set of processes to define a problem.
# Pre-planning and pseudo code are vital in thinking through design choices prior to implementing, although much
# trial and error is to be expected even in light of careful planning.  Classes are often best represented by the
# nouns in the problem you're trying to solve.  Attributes of each class can be considered characteristics of the
# nouns in the problem being solved.  Functions within the class are actions or duties that noun would undertake -
# look for verbs. As an example, a patient class could have attributes of patient ID, gender, and last visit date.  A
# function could calculate time elapsed since current time (now) and most recent prior visit. Scaled, this eventually
# represents building a flexible, dynamic program.

# 2. Encapsulation - separating implementation details of an object from how the object is used
# Polymorphism - Different classes implementing the same methods (functions),
# allows programs to be flexible and allows code to be used in multiple different situations
# Inheritance - creating a
# subclass from a class which has all the class features + some addition features.  Using the patient class example
# above, a subclass could be multiple sclerosis patients who have all the original patient attributes plus attributes
# unique to their condition.
